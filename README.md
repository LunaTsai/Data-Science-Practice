# Data Science with Python Workshop @McGill
The Python code presented here reflects the hands-on exercises conducted during the Data Science workshops organized by CDSI (Computational and Data Systems Initiative) at McGill University.
These codes cover essential topics such as Data Visualization(with matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn), Data Wrangling(with numpy, and pandas), and Exploratory Data Analysis.
